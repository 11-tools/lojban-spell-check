= Resources for Lojban spell cheking
Resources to generate Lojban spell check dictionaries for various software. This doesn't contain the actual useable dictionaries.
Please visit https://github.com/Sukender/lojban-spell-check-dist to get the dictionaries/installers/packages.

These are ultra-basic dictionaries for Lojban, based on ANSI characters (~= latin alphabet).
The result is clearly simplistic, of poor quality, and maybe inaccurate. But still better than nothing!

To do:
 - libreoffice oxt : make XCU file content dynamic (language code).
